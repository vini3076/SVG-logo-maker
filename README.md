# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This is a node.js application which generates a logo after the user answers a series of four questions:
- Please enter logo text between 1-3 characters.
- What shape do you want? They have a choice of:['Circle', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle']
- Enter the color keyword or hexadecimal number for the shape color (default Black): If they don't enter anything it will default to black.
- Enter the color keyword or hexadecimal number for the text color(default White): If they don't enter anything it will default to white.

This project solidified my object-oriented concepts and taught me how to create tests. To further my learning, I want to learn how to make my tests more efficient.
